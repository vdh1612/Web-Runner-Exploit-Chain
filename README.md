# Web Runner: Exploit Chain


### **[Introduction]**

=========================

On many CTF platforms, most labs are either black box or grey box, which leaves people who are new to web pentesting confused about how vulnerabilities actually work. To solve this, I’m trying to develop a path of whitebox labs to help those beginners can truly understand what happens behind the scenes. The ideas of these labs are based on most classic web vulnerabilities or combined with my own scenario.

### **[Use cases]**

=========================

- Deploy lab by docker.
- Reconnaissance: gather information about the website with the hidden path like robots.txt, .htaccess, admin.php…..
- Try to find the vulnerabilities on the website and combine the pentest technique to get the flag.
- Study from the easiest to the hardest level.

### **[Expected outcomes]**

=========================

providing a hands-on learning experience for individuals, help them to gain experience in identifying and exploiting these vulnerabilities, with detailed documentation provided for each lab allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of vulnerabilities and how they operate.
