# Web Runner: Exploit Chain


### **[Introduction]**

On many CTF platforms, most labs are either black box or grey box, which leaves people who are new to web pentesting confused about how vulnerabilities actually work. To solve this, Iâ€™m trying to develop a path of whitebox labs to help those beginners can truly understand what happens behind the scenes. The ideas of these labs are based on most classic web vulnerabilities or combined with my own scenario.

### **[Expected outcomes]**

providing a hands-on learning experience for individuals, help them to gain experience in identifying and exploiting these vulnerabilities, with detailed documentation provided for each lab allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of vulnerabilities and how they operate.
